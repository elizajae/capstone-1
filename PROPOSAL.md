Bookify

An app to gamify reading

1.  The goal my website is designed to achieve is to gamify reading, encouraging readers to read more

2. The type of users that will visit my site are readers of any age who enjoy things like video games that give you a sense of progression

3. The data I plan on using from the API are:
The catalogue of books to search and add books
The meta information of books to track progress of pages read

4.
My database schema will contain 1 table for users, 1 table for the users virtual bookshelf entries, and one table tracking gamification
I may hit request limits or an obscure book may not be in the database
I would need to secure the user account information only
The app will have a user profile, a virtual bookshelf, and an ability to log books and ear progress
The user will sign up if not logged in. They will search for books and add them to their shelf. As they read they will update the progress on the app and earn XP for progress.
The gamification feature is what makes my site more than just a CRUD app interacting with an API
